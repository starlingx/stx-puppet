This package contains a module for use by puppet. It is
automatically added to the module load path of puppet's default
environment, and should be ready for use.

You can use "update-alternatives --config puppet-module-starlingx-dcagent""
to configure which module should appear in the module path of the
default puppet environment, in case multiple modules which provide
the same name are installed.
